This is an iOS-esque spinner implementation.  

The non-Flex version (listed in the "as3" directory) has not been optimize for mobile.  It makes use of runtime filters, which degrade performance on mobile.

The Flex version has been partially optimized for mobile and will work for most general use-cases.  Where it will not perform well is in handling large lists.

TO DO:
- Update AS3 version to use virtual list with smooth scrolling (ASList repository)
- Remove filters from AS3 version and replace with bitmap gradients
- Potentially swap out custom list for Flex virtual list component
- Continue work to expose dials, data and renderers on component
- Make a formal SWC package for the component
