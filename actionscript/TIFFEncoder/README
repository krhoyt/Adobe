Honestly, I do not recall why I built this example.  I think a customer told me that they needed a TIFF encoder, and since ActionScript did not have one, they could not move forward.  I know image file formats pretty well, so I sat down with the documentation for the afternoon and made it happen.  This is just a basic encoder.  There is not decoder.  If you would like to contribute to include a decoder, then by all means, please get involved.  I have been asked for this code by various customers, and almost lost it once, so it is posted here for all to leverage and build upon.
