This is a collection of examples showing how to connect Adobe AIR to Phidgets and Arduino hardware.  Adobe AIR is a cross-platform runtime.  Applications can be authored with Flash, Flex and HTML/JavaScript/CSS.  These examples all revolve around the HTML/JavaScript/CSS workflow, as there are plenty of resources in existence for the other workflows.

On the Phidgets side, there is one moving piece that is outside of my direct control - there is a SWF library that is needed to connect from AIR to the Phidgets local driver (a socket with a custom communication protocol).  This SWF must be created with other, Flash-oriented tools.  Phidgets provides the source for the socket in ActionScript, and many other languages, but not JavaScript.  The Flash tools compile this ActionScript source code into a library SWF.  The SWF can then be included like any other library in HTML (via the SCRIPT tag).

Phidgets updates their communication libraries on a regular and ongoing basis.  When they do, something changes that makes this library no longer work, and need to be recompiled from the latest builds (available on the Phidgets web site).  If anybody has a contact at Phidgets, I would greatly appreciate an introduction so we might potential resolve this shortcoming, and make a native JavaScript version.
